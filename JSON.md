# JSON - JavaScript Object Notation

[JSON](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) is a portable data-interchange format which represents common value-types as a sequence of Unicode characters.

```javascript
{
    "lang": "JSON",
    "ast": <string>
}
```

The `ast` string is the transportable representation of a single JSON value.

## JSON Data

A JSON value can be an _object_, _array_, _number_, _string_, `true`, `false`, or `null`. The abstract value represented by a JSON-encoded string is defined by the [standards for JSON parsers](http://ftp.ripe.net/rfc/authors/rfc8259.txt). The JSON-encoded string representing abstract values is also specified by those same standards. These provide a bi-directional representation relation between abstract values and concrete Unicode character-sequences. Many commonly-used abstract values are representable in JSON, but there are also un-representable values (such as Infinity). The [crlf project](README.md) uses the abstract values of JSON as foundation for _representation_ of abstract values in other domains.

### `null` value

`null` is a singular unique abstract value, often used to indicate the concept of "nothing". It is equal only to itself.

### Boolean type (`true` and `false` values)

The abstract values `true` and `false` are the two values of used in [Boolean logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra). Predicates (such as comparing two values for equality) produce a `true` or `false` result.
